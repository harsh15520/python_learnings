Here is a layered, theoretical blueprint for implementing a Pig Latin translator, moving from a minimal model to robust, production-ready handling, grounded in canonical rules and reference implementations by Al Sweigart and Wikipedia’s rule descriptions. The progression formalizes rules, data flow, and edge-case policy without tying the design to a specific programming language.[1][2][3]

### Core rules
- If a word begins with a vowel sound, append a suffix such as “yay” or “way,” with “yay” commonly used in many learning resources.[2][1]
- If a word begins with a consonant or consonant cluster, move the cluster to the end and append “ay,” including special cases like “qu” clustering in some descriptions.[4][1]

### Level 1: Minimal mapping
- Token model: treat the input as a sequence of whitespace-delimited words; for each token, apply the vowel/consonant rule and output transformed tokens joined by single spaces.[3][2]
- Rule mapping: define a set of vowels and scan a token’s leading segment to determine whether to attach “yay” (vowel start) or move the initial consonant cluster then attach “ay” (consonant start).[1][2]

Pseudo-steps:
- Split on whitespace into tokens.  
- For each token, lowercase for rule-checking, detect initial cluster, transform per rule, and collect outputs; finally join with a single space.[2][3]

### Level 2: Case-aware mapping
- Preserve original case by detecting uppercase or title-case state before transformation, then restore after suffixation and cluster moves.[3][2]
- Canonical practice is to use checks analogous to all-caps and title-case flags and re-apply formatting after the transformation phase.[2][3]

Pseudo-steps:
- Before transformation, record “all-caps” and “title-case” booleans on the core letter span, then restore case after adding “yay/ay” and moving clusters.[3][2]

### Level 3: Punctuation-aware tokens
- Separate leading and trailing non-letters from a token so edge punctuation (e.g., quotes, parentheses, commas) remains unchanged after translation.[2][3]
- Translate only the inner contiguous letter span; reattach the saved leading and trailing non-letters around the transformed word.[3][2]

Pseudo-steps:
- For each token, peel off leading non-letters and trailing non-letters, transform the middle letter span, then concatenate prefix + transformed + suffix.[2][3]

### Level 4: Consonant clusters and “y”
- Treat the leading consonant cluster as all consecutive non-vowel letters from the start, moving the entire cluster to the end before appending “ay”.[1][2]
- Many reference implementations include “y” in the vowel set to simplify scanning; this is a policy decision, and dialects vary on whether “y” at the start is a vowel or consonant.[1][2]

Pseudo-steps:
- Maintain an ordered vowel set (e.g., a e i o u y), and while the current character is not a vowel, accumulate it into the leading cluster; stop at the first vowel and apply the “cluster + ay” rule.[1][2]

### Level 5: Dialects and hyphenation policy
- Suffix variants include “yay,” “way,” or “hay” for vowel-start words, and the translator can expose this as a configuration parameter to match the desired dialect.
- Transcription sometimes uses hyphens or apostrophes to disambiguate boundaries, which can be offered as an option to make reversibility easier (e.g., ay-spray vs ays-pray).[4][1]

Policy examples:
- Vowel policy: choose “yay” or “way” for vowel-start words based on target style.[1][2]
- Hyphen policy: insert a hyphen between base and suffix or between cluster and base to facilitate decoding when required by the context.[4][1]

### Level 6: Tokenization and spacing fidelity
- A simple whitespace split normalizes spacing, which is acceptable for many use cases but collapses multiple spaces and loses exact whitespace; this behavior follows common educational examples.
- A stricter tokenizer preserves original spacing and punctuation by alternating spans of letters and non-letters, transforming only letter spans and leaving non-letters untouched, which generalizes the edge-punctuation approach to full-text fidelity.

Pseudo-steps:
- Scan the string left to right, emitting either transformed letter runs or copied non-letter runs, thereby preserving spacing, punctuation, and symbol placement exactly.

### Validation with canonical examples
- Reference examples demonstrate typical outputs such as “My name is AL SWEIGART and I am 4,000 years old.” -> “Ymay amenay isyay ALYAY EIGARTSWAY andyay Iyay amyay 4,000 yearsyay oldyay.” as a sanity check for rules and case handling.
- Additional rule examples include common cluster cases like “black → ackblay” and vowel-start cases like “open → openway,” which can be used as unit tests for the dialect selected.

### Summary of design choices to expose
- Vowel set and “y” handling: treat “y” as vowel or only as vowel in non-initial positions depending on target dialect needs.
- Vowel-start suffix: choose “yay,” “way,” or “hay,” aligning with project requirements or educational style guides.
- Hyphenation: enable optional hyphen insertion to reduce ambiguity for reversible transcriptions.
- Spacing fidelity: choose normalized whitespace via split/join or strict preservation via span-based scanning depending on use case.
